================

- [Supplement A (`descriptives.pdf`)](descriptives.pdf) contains the descriptive statistics of the data used in the paper.
- [Supplement B (`variables.pdf`)](variables.pdf) contains descriptions of the variables used in the paper.
- [Supplement C (`reform_restriction.pdf`](reform_restriction.pdf) contains results from the model focusing on focal fathers eligible for 2013 reform.
- [Supplement D (`timegap_restriction.pdf`)[timegap_restriction.pdf] contains results from the model which restricted the sample based on the time gap between births.
- File [`sample_data_construction.R`](sample_data_construction.R) contains the code used to create the
  data for the modelling, based on the full sample created in
  [`full_data_construction.R`](full_data_construction.R). The source data is only accessible via
  Statistics Finland’s remote access system
  [FIONA](https://stat.fi/tup/tutkijapalvelut/fiona-etakayttojarjestelma_en.html).
  Data description is available at [INVEST Data
  Catalog](https://investdata.utu.fi/catalog) (INVEST Data (e17)).
- File [`model_estimation.R`](model_estimation.R) contains the codes for estimating the main
  model of the paper, using the Stan model in [`model.stan`](model.stan).
- Files [`model_estimation_from_2013.R`](model_estimation_from_2013.R) and
  [`model_estimation_timegap_restriction.R`](model_estimation_timegap_restriction.R) contain the codes for the
  models using the limited data of the robustness checks of the
  supplementary materials.
- File [`causal_effects.R`](causal_effects.R) was be used to compute the causal effect
  estimates, and [`figures.R`](figures.R) was used to create the figures of the paper
  and supplementary material.
